This product includes software developed by The Apache Software Foundation
(http://www.apache.org/).

Apache Tuscany is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), 
sponsored by the Apache Web Services PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted 
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, 
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful 
ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness 
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed 
by the ASF.
