Building the Apache Tuscany SCA 1.6.1 September 2010 Release source distribution
================================================================================

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install either of the following:
   a) Java SE 5.0 SDK (version 1.5.0_22 or higher), which can be downloaded from
      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp
   b) Java SE 6.0 SDK (version 1.6.0_07 or higher), which can be downloaded from
      http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads

2) Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the installed 
   JDK location, and that your PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or 
   $JAVA_HOME$/bin (unix).

3) Install Maven 2.0.10 or higher, which can be downloaded from 
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes 
   the $M2_HOME$/bin directory. 

4) Make sure that your MAVEN_OPTS environment variable has -Xmx128m (or more)
   and -XX:MaxPermSize=256m (or more). You can do this manually by executing
   the following in your prompt:
   Windows users:
     set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
   Unix users:
     export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m


Building
--------

1) Change to the top level directory of the Apache Tuscany SCA source distribution.
2) Run

	$> mvn

   This will compile Apache Tuscany SCA and run all of the tests in the source
   distribution. 

   Depending on the load of remote Maven 2.0 repositories, you may have 
   to run 'mvn' several times utill the required dependencies are 
   all located in your local maven repository. It usually takes some time for 
   maven to download required dependencies in the first build. Once all the 
   dependencies have been downloaded you may use the -o option to run maven
   in offline mode, for example, 'mvn clean install -o'.


Building the distributions
--------------------------

1) Change to the distribution folder
2) Run

	$> mvn

   This will build the binary and source distributions with .zip and .gz 
   formats in the distribution/target directory.
