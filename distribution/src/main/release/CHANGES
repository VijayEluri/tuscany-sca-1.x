Changes With Apache Tuscany SCA 1.5 May 2009 
============================================

- Add dependency on jaxws (as the code now uses the Holder class) so it compiles on pre-JDK6
- Merge branch 'tuscany-2663'
- Remove unneeded deploy.xml and .componentType files
- Reverting changes from revision #734356 and there was some merge conflicts that were not supposed to get to svn.
- TUSCANY-2463 - Properly register default attribute processor to handle extended attributes
- Exclude xsd module from base
- Fixes for TUSCANY-2772
-  Renaming test cases to follow same naming pattern
- Updating testcase to JUnit 4
- TUSCANY-2463 - Storing extended attributes in a second list, wrapped into a extension class that stores the attribute QName, it's value
- Removing obsolet test composite
- TUSCANY-2663 - UPdating test scenarios to split valid extended element from invalid scenario where require attribute has empty value
- TUSCANY-2463 - Last adjustments to test processors to support the extension attribute wrapper
- TUSCANY-2463 - Fixing model object definition for extended attribute processor

- TUSCANY-2784 - Integrating Java EE schema to sca schema
- Move to a seperate itest as that makes the itest simpler
- Add an itest for folder contributions and zip contributions containing jars
- Demonstrate how the non-JAXWS base class can be used. Add some ignores.
- Start looking at seperating out the JMS service side listener functions into a pluggable module so different runtime environments can plug in their own runtime specific code. This should help the geronimo plugin support JMS using the Geronimo JMS provider and JCA, and any others who are using Tuscany deeply embedded in a container. Not in the build yet or used by the current JMS binding till it gets a bit further
- and related to r737718 a module for the current JMS binding listener code that uses the 'asf' approach of a JMS listener spawning unmanaged threads to process messages
- TUSCANY-2794 - JMS callback property variable ends with space - not a valid Javaidentifier
- Removing holder-ws-service from pom as it seems the sample is not available
- Process services in component pre-processing.

- Removing system.out from AnyAttribute test case
- Removing unused imports
- TUSCANY-2701  NPE when verifying conformance item ASM60006 in OASIS sepc
- TUSCANY-2799 - don't return responses inside arrays. Generally reorg the code so that the message processors only worry about getting data in and out of JMS message while the interceptors worry about whether the data should be wrapped as an array. In this way the forward path can do array wrapping in order to keep databinding happy while the response path can omit array wrapping
- Commit update to jms sca binding left off the change to the JMS binding to use the JMS Host
- TUSCANY-2799 Fix NPE in JMS Object wire format when a null object is returned. Add a test also.

- TUSCANY-2463 - Fixing Web Service binding processor to propertly get a reference to Extended Attribute processor
- Fixes for MTOM TestCase
- TUSCANY-2824 - Turn the binding.ws policy handlers back on. The ws policy handlers are now present but commented out as they are causing problems in the Axis 1.4.1 stack. Update the keys for the binding.ws tests cases so they remain valid for a long time. 
- TUSCANY-2835 JMS Binding does not save operation names unless there are properties.
- Merge branch 'bpel-resolver'

- Remove erronious warning about response connection factory not being processed
- TUSCANY-2841: start to add support for using a seperate response connection factory
- Update for resource factory changes
- Update noreply itest for change to not return Object arrays
- Add jms noreply itest to itest build
- Update jms response connectionFactory itest to correctly setup jndi resources
- TUSCANY-2839: Start at supporting services invoked by oneway requests not needing a response connection factory
- TUSCANY-2824 - turn WSSecurity based policy back on. Two not so great fixes here. Firstly WSSecurityPolicyHandler pushes a property into the Axis configuration context to force Rampart to recognize the policy. I haven't discovered what part of our configuration is required to do this properly. Secondly I fixed the helloworld-ws-service-secure test case to reference the wsdl on binding.ws. Without this you get a NPE in axis/rampart as it fails to map binding operations to port type operation using QNames (don't know why it thinks these are QNames). Our generated WSDL has the generated binding in a different namespace to the port type. Associating the wsdl binding with binding.ws means that the binding is not generated at the made up QNames match. I also updated a few key stores as the runtime was complaining about X509 certificate version numbers.

- TUSCANY-2930 main part of separating wireFormat.jmsdefault out from wireFormat.jmsTextXML. I've spotted a few more things that need fixing but this basic functionality passes all of our current JMS tests and now better matched what the specification says about default format.
- TUSCANY-2930 extend default format test for the chase where default is specified on reference but not on the service
- Move the JAX-WS holder testing logic to interface-java-jaxws
- TUSCANY-2986 - move the callback processing into a separate interceptor to allow other operation selectors to use it. Don't have any others just yet but about to add another one. 
- TUSCANY-2987 code to make nativeOperation based operation selection work and add new operation selector (jmsUser) that allows you to specify what JMS message property holds the operation name. No test cases yet. 
- TUSCANY-2977 determine implementation.jee component type from application composite if one is available
- o Updated artifactId to the correct (long) one.
- TUSCANY-2987, TUSCANY-2964. Rename operation selector that allows the user to specify which message property holds the operation name. Add tests cases for this and the default selector. Rename default selector to be all lowers case (it's still in the Tuscany namespace though)
- TUSCANY-2965 - add a jmsBytesXML wireFormat analogous to jmsTextXML
- TUSCANY-2966 - reset bytes message after read in operation selector so that following wire format can re-read bytes if required. 
- Update the tuscany part of the JMS binding schema to take account of recent wireFormat and opertionSelector changes. These schema type are not wired into the binding.jms schema at the moment (we rely on anys) but it's useful to keep track of the shape of these elements. 
- Add some ignores
- TUSCANY-2626 - add EndpointReference back into the binding.ws schema. This is not the wsa:EnpointReference though. To get this to work I have had  EndpointReference goes in the target namespace. The code to read EndpointReference still reads wsa:EndpointReference so this shouldn't break anyone already using that but at least it gives the reader an idea about what can validly go in the schema. 
- Fix the ArrayOutofBoundException that causes the hang of itest/helloworld-bpel
- set svn:ignore
- Make sure the default mode is set to INOUT if the type is Holder.class
- TUSCANY-2626 add file missed in previous commit for this JIRA
- The war file generated by the jee sample project has a long name.  Updating the url accordingly.
- Code update to support external EAR has broken this test. Ignoring the test for now.
- TUSCANY-2953 Fix sca.tld in branches-1.x
- Uncommenting contribution-jee itest.

- Removing data-engine-helper from pom as it was moved to contrib
- Fix for TUSCANY-3000
- Add a apace for the error message
- Fix the clone()
- TUSCANY-2996 - Add support for wrapSingle attribute that, when set true, ensures that single parameters are wrapped in an array on the wire. When set false single parameters will not be wrapped on the wire. Multiple parameters will always be wrapped. 
- Add ignore
- TUSCANY-2965 - add fault handling code for wireFormat.bytesXML
- TUSCANY-2993 Fix global variable handling that was causing store-dojo to fail with internet explorer
- Move the Holder logic into JAXWS interface processor

- Set svn:ignore
- Add annotation dependency as the provided scope is not transitive
- Update to cargo plugin 1.0
- Refactor the data transformation and copy logic into Mediator utility
- Add jee contribution samples to the build as the contribution-jee itest depends on it
- TUSCANY-3002: fix writeStartElement calls in JMSBindingProcessor do not pass namespace
- Clean up imports
- TUSCANY-3006 - Disabling failing test cases
- TUSCANY-2968 - Updating binding-http schema and moving wireFormat and operationSelector to tuscany-sca-core.xsd to be sharable
- TUSCANY-2968 - Changing binding to tuscany namespace and other small updates
- TUSCANY-2968 - Renaming new binding.http module to avoid confusion with the oasis draft, as we are not really implementing the whole spec but just following the wireFormat and operationSelector options implemented in binding.jms
- Double the time the test waits for the time to live to be set into the initial context as it's failing on my machine with the existing timeout. 
- TUSCANY-2978 - Add some more sample archives based on the scenarios here http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TUSCANYWIKI/Java+EE+Integration
- TUSCANY-2978 - Add test code to exercise new JEE sample archives including code to show how to process an archive that appears outside of the contribution that references it. See TestExternalEarModelResolver.java. Some jee processing changes were required to make this work.
- TUSCANY-3008 disable reference test in testContributeEAR_Enhanced16 until this problem is fixed
- Remove the unused mediator lookup
- TUSCANY-2968 - JSONRPC operation selector
- TUSCANY-2968 - Moving unit tests to iTest to avoid circular references

- TUSCANY-2968 - Setting JSON dataBinding on service interface contract
- TUSCANY-2968 - Enabling more tests that are currently passing
- Add host-jetty dependency as binging-http needs are servlet host. For some reason this test works OK in Eclipse but doesn't work in Maven. So eclipse is picking up the jetty dependency from somewhere else. Ass some ignores also. 
- Tidy comment
- TUSCANY-3005 - Take account of the case where there are either no input parameters or a void return type (or both). Thanks for the patch Kaushik.

Changes With Apache Tuscany SCA 1.0 (incubating) September 2007 
===============================================================

- Tuscany Java SCA now implements V1.0 of the core SCA 
  specifications
        SCA Assembly Model V1.0
        SCA Java Common Annotations and APIs V1.0
        SCA Java Component Implementation V1.0
        SCA Web Services Binding V1.0
  Including callbacks, conversations and callable references
  

- Support for ws-security configurable in the web services binding
  thro Tuscany SCA policy intents and policysets using the policy framework 
  introduced in the last release.  
  
  Note : This release supports specifications of policies around axis2
         config params - see helloworld-ws-service-secure sample.  The policy
         intents that have been tested are authentication, integrity and 
         confidentiality.  
         There is no sample or test that exercises confidentiality since there
         are some unresolved licensing issue around bouncycastle libraries.  
         However, users who are not encumbered by the bouncycastle license 
         restrictions can try the 'confidentiality' intent. See FAQ - 
         http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany/tuscany-sca-java-faq.html
                
         This release does not include support for WS-Policy
         attachments in Tuscany Policysets for ws-security.
         
  
- An XQuery component implementation type 
        implementation-xquery
        

- A Databinding for converting data to and from nodes for XQuery 
  processing
        databinding-saxon
        

- OSGI support has been extended to allow Tuscany contributions 
  packaged as OSGI bundles hence taking advantage of OSGI's bundle
  loading an dependency management capabilities 
  

- A BPEL component implementation type experimental implementation
based on SCA BPEL Client and Implementation V1.0. At the moment only
supports BPEL process as services.
	implementation-bpel


- The distributed runtime implementation has been separated out 
  into 
        *) domain
        *) node
  It is now wrapped by a SCADomain interface as is the standalone 
  runtime.
  
  Note: This release does not include support for WebApp host deployment 
        for a distributed SCA Domain 
  


- The web service binding will now generate WSDL automatically
  based on the service interface if no WSDL is provided
  

- A new "store" sample and associated document show how a 
  simple store front application can be constructed 
        samples/store
        
- The following features of this release are still experimental:
     - BPEL implementation type, integrating with Apache ODE
     - OSGI implementation type, integrating with Apache Felix
     - XQuery implementation type

 

Changes With Apache Tuscany SCA 0.99 (incubating) August 2007 
=============================================================

The following are the significant additions to release 0.99 
over and above all of what was offered in release 0.91.

- A version of the default sca binding that works between
  components runing in separate Java virtual machines
       binding-sca-axis

- A simple node implementation and a service discovery 
  function for running sca applications distributed 
  across more than one node
       distributed
       distributed-impl 

- integration with OSGi runtimes is now supported with
  a new implementation-osgi component type

- PUB/SUB interactions are now supported by using new 
  notification binding and implementation types, and
  samples demonstrating the feature.

- The Tuscany runtime now has a policy framework supporting
  the SCA policy specification

- the endpoint URIs used by SCA bindings has been rationalized 
  and now follows the SCA Assembly specification

- binding-ajax has been renamed to binding-dwr
