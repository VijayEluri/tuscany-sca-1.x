    <!-- In Tuscany 1.5.1 the command-line launcher for the domain manager
       is hard wired to use the current directory for the domain configuration,
       so we use a custom launcher to override this setting using the domain
       manager API.  Note that the classpath only includes the node launcher
       jar which will bootstrap the rest of the Tuscany runtime. -->
