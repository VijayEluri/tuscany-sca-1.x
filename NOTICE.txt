Apache Tuscany is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Apache Web Services PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed
by the ASF.
