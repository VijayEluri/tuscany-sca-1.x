Building Tuscany SCA
====================

Building this distribution requires a Maven 2.0.4 which can be downloaded from
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html

Maven automatically downloads project dependencies from remote repositories
so a live internet connection is required the first time a build is run.
For details of which repositories are used please consult pom.xml in this
directory or in specific modules. Commonly used repositories are:
   http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-incubating-repository/
   http://download.eclipse.org/tools/emf/maven2
   https://maven-repository.dev.java.net/nonav/repository

Due to load on these servers you may experience occasional download failures.
If these should occur simply rerun the build.

The build generates a binary distribution intended for download from a
distribution server and a number of other artifacts intended for distribution
through the Maven repository system. Those include Maven plugins that can be
used to build SCA applications intended to run on Apache Tuscany.


Building
--------
To perform a default build run mvn from this directory. This build installs
all module files in your local Maven repository (located by default in
${user.home}/.m2/repository ) ready for deployment to a remote repository.
It also assembles a binary distribution in the distribution module.
