
Building the travel sample using ant
------------------------------------

1. Download and unzip JDK 6 update 7 (or later) or JDK 5 update 22, and set
   the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK base directory.
2. Install svn and ant.
3. Create a local directory to hold the travel sample code.  With this as
   your current directory, check out the complete travel sample from svn
   using the following command:
     svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tuscany/sca-java-1.x/trunk/tutorials/travelsample
4. Download and unzip the Tuscany SCA Java 1.6 (or later) binary distribution
   and set the TUSCANY_HOME environment variable to the base directory
   containing the unzipped binary distribution.
5. Download and unzip the OpenEJB 3.1.2 (or later) binary distribution and set
   the OPENEJB_HOME environment variable to the base directory containing
   the unzipped binary distribution.
6. If you are using JDK 5, download and unzip the JAX-WS reference implementation
   version 2.1.7 and set the JAXWS_HOME environment variable to the base directory
   containing the unzipped download.
7. With the travelsample directory as your current directory, enter the
   command "ant compile".


Building the travel sample using maven
--------------------------------------

Most of the steps are similar to the above.  For completeness, a full list
of the steps needed is given here.

1. Download and unzip JDK 6 update 7 (or later) or JDK 5 update 22, and set
   the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK base directory.
2. Install svn and maven.
3. Create a local directory to hold the travel sample code.  With this as
   your current directory, check out the complete travel sample from svn
   using the following command:
     svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tuscany/sca-java-1.x/trunk/tutorials/travelsample
4. Check the setting of the <tuscany.version> property in the
   travelsample/pom.xml file.  If you want to build the travel sample using
   a different Tuscany version, change this property as necessary.  The
   travel sample has been tested and runs correctly with Tuscany SCA Java 1.6. 
5. With the travelsample directory as your current directory, enter the
   command "mvn".  You will need a live internet connection so that maven
   can download any required files to your local repository.
6. By default the maven build produces a binary distribution that is an
   add-on delta to the Tuscany SCA Java 1.6 binary distribution.  If you
   want to produce a fully self-contained binary distribution for the
   travel sample, you can use the command "mvn -Pselfcontained" instead
   of "mvn" to do this.


Running the travel sample from the build directories
----------------------------------------------------

The travel sample consists of a number of related scenarios.  These scenarios
are listed below, together with instructions for running them.  The instructions
in this section will work irrespective of whether the travel sample was built
using ant or maven.

Most of the scenarios are run by opening a single command prompt window
and entering the command "ant run" into that window.  If a scenario is
listed with multiple commands, this means that it needs multiple command
prompt windows.  In this case, each of the listed commands must be entered
into its own separate command prompt window in the order shown.

Before running these scenarios, you need to perform the setup described above
in "Building the travel sample using ant" if you have not already done this.

Some of the scenarios are packaged as web applications (.war files).  Instead
of being run from the command line, these are deployed to a suitable web
application server (such as Apache Tomcat) and run from a browser.

For each scenario, the following are listed below:
 Command(s): the command or commands for running the scenario, if any
 Directory: the current directory for the command prompt window or windows
 Webapp: .war file to be deployed for this scenario, if any
 URL(s): browser URL or URLs used to run this scenario, if any

Running the travel sample from the distribution directories
-----------------------------------------------------------

If the travel sample was built using maven, a binary distribution
directory will be created containing all the built jar files, together with
some directories containing runtime dependencies for these jar files.

The following directories contain the jar files for the travel sample:
  clients - non-SCA clients using various communication technologies
  contributions - SCA contributions for the travel sample
  launchers - executable launchers for the travel sample
  services - non-SCA services using various communication technologies
  util - jar files needed by other jars in the travel sample

The following directories contain runtime dependencies of the above jar files:
  domainconfig - domain configuration files
  jaxws - JAX-WS runtime jars neeed when running the travel sample on JDK 5
  lib - Tuscany runtime jars and their dependencies needed by the travel sample
     (only present if the travel sample was  built using "mvn -Pselfcontained")
  ode - JPA Derby database needed by the ODE runtime
  openejb - OpenEJB 3.1.2 runtime jars needed by the travel sample

You can run each of the scenarios from the binary distribution by running one
or more jar files using ant scripts that are included in the binary distribution.

The ant commands that you need to use for running each scenario are listed below.
If multiple ant commands are listed for a scenario, they must be run in
separate processes in the order listed.  The current directory when invoking
the ant command must be set as follows:
 launchers/scatours-launcher-*.jar are run from the launchers directory 
 clients/scatours-client-*.jar are run from the clients directory 
 services/scatours-service-*.jar are run from the services directory
 
To run a jar, you need to used the command "ant run-jarsuffix" where
"jarsuffix" is the last part of the jar file name omitting the standard prefix
"scatours-client", "scatours-launcher" or "scatours-service".  For example,
to run the "jumpstart" scenario, you would set your current directory to the
binary distribution "launchers" directory and run the command
  ant run-jumpstart
This runs the travel sample jar file scatours-launcher-jumpstart.jar using a
classpath with the required runtime dependencies from the Tuscany SCA binary
distribution.  The location of the Tuscany SCA binary distribution is specified
by the TUSCANY_HOME environment variable).

If the travel sample binary distribution was built using the "mvn -Pselfcontained"
command, you can use the "java -jar" command to run the travel sample executable
jars directly as an alternative to using ant scripts.  For example, instead of
using the command
  ant run-jumpstart
you can use the command
  java -jar scatours-launcher-jumpstart.jar

Here is a complete list of the ant commands to run the scenarios described above
from the travel sample binary distribution.  These are run from the "launchers"
directory unlesss otherwise indicated.
