To build this plugin, do the following:

- copy the JARs in the lib directory of the Tuscany release 1.0 binary distribution to the plugin lib directory
- copy apache-tuscany-sca-1.0-incubating-src.zip from the Tuscany release 1.0 binary distribution to the plugin src directory

Eventually these steps should be automated as part of the build process for this plugin.
