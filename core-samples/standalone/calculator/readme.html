<h1>Apache Tuscany Calculator Sample Application</h1>

<p>
    This sample illustrates the use of SCA to wire components together inside a composite.
    All connections between the components are local and are defined using Java interfaces.
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
    Please install Apache Maven and build the library composites as described in the
    <a href="../../readme.html#GettingStarted">Getting Started</a> section of the root readme.
</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>To build the sample run:</p>
  <pre class="command">
$ mvn package
</pre>
<p>
    This will build and package the code that calls the calculator composite from a
    command line client environment.
</p>

<h2>Running</h2>
<p>
    To run the client, use the <code>launcher</code> command from the standalone distribution:
</p>
<pre class="command">
$ java -jar {tuscany.installDir}/bin/launcher.jar target/calc.jar {add|subtract|multiply|divide} {param} {param}
</pre>

<p>where <code>tuscany.installDir</code> is the path where you installed the standalone distribution.</p>

<p>
    The sample when run will display to the standard output:
</p>
<pre class="command">
$ java -jar {tuscany.installDir}/bin/launcher.jar target/calc.jar add 2 5
result = 7.0
</pre>
</body>
