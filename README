
Building the travel sample using ant
------------------------------------

1. Download and unzip JDK 1.6.0_07 (or later) and set the JAVA_HOME
   environment variable to the JDK base directory.
2. Install svn and ant.
3. Create a local directory to hold the travel sample code.  With this as
   your current directory, check out the complete travel sample from svn
   using the following command:
     svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tuscany/sca-java-1.x/trunk/tutorials/travelsample
4. Download and unzip the Tuscany SCA Java 1.6 (or later) binary distribution
   and set the TUSCANY_HOME environment variable to the base directory
   containing the unzipped binary distribution.
5. Download and unzip the OpenEJB 3.0 (or later) binary distribution and set
   the OPENEJB_HOME environment variable to the base directory containing
   the unzipped binary distribution.
6. With the travelsample directory as your current directory, enter the
   command "ant compile".


Building the travel sample using maven
--------------------------------------

Most of the steps are similar to the above.  For completeness, a full list
of the steps needed is given here.

1. Download and unzip JDK 1.6.0_07 (or later) and set the JAVA_HOME
   environment variable to the JDK base directory.
2. Install svn and maven.
3. Create a local directory to hold the travel sample code.  With this as
   your current directory, check out the complete travel sample from svn
   using the following command:
     svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tuscany/sca-java-1.x/trunk/tutorials/travelsample
4. Check the setting of the <tuscany.version> property in the
   travelsample/pom.xml file.  If you want to build the travel sample using
   a different Tuscany version, change this property as necessary.  The
   travel sample has been tested and runs correctly with Tuscany SCA Java 1.6. 
5. With the travelsample directory as your current directory, enter the
   command "mvn".  You will need a live internet connection so that maven
   can download any required files to your local repository.


Running the travel sample from the build directories
----------------------------------------------------

The travel sample consists of a number of related scenarios.  These scenarios
are listed below, together with instructions for running them.  The instructions
in this section will work irrespective of whether the travel sample was built
using ant or maven.

Most of the scenarios are run by opening a single command prompt window
and entering the command "ant run" into that window.  If a scenario is
listed with multiple commands, this means that it needs multiple command
prompt windows.  In this case, each of the listed commands must be entered
into its own separate command prompt window in the order shown.

For each scenario, the following are given:
 Directory: the current directory for the command prompt window or windows
 Command(s): the command or commands for running the scenario
 Contributions: SCA contributions used in this scenario
 Launchers: other launcher directories used in this scenario, if any

Running the travel sample from the distribution directories
-----------------------------------------------------------

If the travel sample was built using maven, a binary distribution
directory will be created containing all the built jar files together with
a "lib" directory containing a complete set of runtime dependencies for
these jar files.  You can run each of the scenarios from the binary
distribution by running one or more jar files using the "java -jar" command.

The jar files that you need to run for each scenario are listed below.
If multiple jar files are listed for a scenario, they must be run in
separate processes in the order listed.  The current directory for
the "java -jar" command must be set as follows:
 launchers/scatours-launcher-*.jar are run from the launchers directory 
 clients/scatours-client-*.jar are run from the clients directory 
 services/scatours-service-*.jar are run from the services directory 

For example, to run the "jumpstart" scenario, you would set your
current directory to the distribution "launchers" directory and run
the command
 java -jar scatours-launcher-jumpstart.jar

Here is a complete list of the launcher commands needed to run the
scenarios described above.
