SCA Samples for Apache Tuscany
==============================

This distribution contains source code for samples that illustrate how to develop
build and run SCA applications using Apache Tuscany 1.0-incubator-M2.

The samples are basically divided into three categories:
* standalone containing simple samples that can be run from the command line
* webapp containing simple samples intended to be deployed to a web container such as Tomcat
* applications containing more complex sample applications

All samples are intended to be built using Maven 2.0.4. For detailed instructions on
building and running individual samples please refer to the README file in each directory.
