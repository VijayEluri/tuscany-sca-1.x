Hello World BPEL Sample
======================================
This sample demonstrates an SCA service implemented by a BPEL process. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

If you just want to run it to see what happens open a command prompt, navigate
to this sample directory and do:

ant run

The sample will start the an embedded BPEL engine, deploy process and invoke it.

Sample Overview
---------------
The sample provides a single component that is wired to a service with a 
web service binding.

  pom.xml                                 - the Maven build file        

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant using the 
following commands

cd helloworld-bpel
ant compile
ant run

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.axiom.
om.util.StAXUtils).
     [java] log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
     [java] HelloWorld server started (press enter to shutdown)
     
As this point the SCA service is exposed as a web service by a web server 
started automatically by the SCA runtime. To stop the server just press 
enter.

To exercise the service run up the helloworld-ws-reference sample. Take a look at 
the README in that sample and you will see you need the following commands

cd helloworld-ws-reference
ant run

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. When using Maven you don't need to run the helloworld-
ws-reference sample as Maven includes a simple ping test to make sure that the
service is available

cd helloworld-ws-service
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.
