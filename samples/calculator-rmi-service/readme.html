  <h3>Tuscany Calculator RMI Service Binding Sample</h3>

  <h4>Overview</h4>

  <p>This sample illustrates the use of Tuscany RMI Binding to expose component services as Java RMI Services. 
  It also demonstrates how a simple Java RMI Client application invoke the SCA Application's services exposed as RMI Services </p>

  <h4>About the sample</h4>
   <p> This sample contains the Calculator SCA Application defined in the CalculatorRMIServer.composite. This composite
   exposes the Calculator functions as RMI Services.
   <p> Besides the classes that provide the basic calculator function, there are two other classes that are key 
   to running this sample. They are : -
   <p>&nbsp;- CalculatorServer.java : This class starts the SCA Runtime and deploys the CalculatorRMIServer.composite.  Running
   this class keeps the SCA Runtime with the deployed application up an running till the 'Enter Key' is pressed on the console.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;- CalculatorClient.java : This is simple Java RMI calculator client that will invoke the Calculator SCA Appplication's
   funtion using Java RMI

   <h4>Running the sample</h4>
   <p> - First run the CalculatorServer class.  This clss will start the SCA Runtime and deploy the CalculatorRMIServer.composite.
   The SCA Runtime will be kept up and running until the 'Enter Key' is pressed on the console.  
   <p> - Next run the CalculatorClient class.  This class will invoke the service provided by the CalculatorServer using Java RMI. Running
   this class successfully will display the following to the standard output: 

<samp>
<br>3 + 2=5.0
<br>3 - 2=1.0
<br>3 * 2=6.0
<br>3 / 2=1.5
   
<p> Now go over to the console running the CalculatorServer and press the 'Enter' key to end that application.
