  <h3>Tuscany Calculator RMI Reference Binding Sample</h3>

  <h4>Overview</h4>

  <p>This sample illustrates the use of Tuscany RMI Binding to call reference services that are hosted as Java RMI services. 
  It also demonstrates how an SCA Client Application can invoke Java RMI Services.


  <h4>About the sample</h4>
   <p> This sample contains the Calculator SCA Application defined in the CalculatorRMIReference.composite. This composite
   wires its service references to a Java RMI service.
   <p> Besides the classes that provide the basic calculator function, there are two other classes that are key 
   to running this sample. They are : -
   <p>&nbsp;- CalculatorServer.java : This class starts the Calculator Application as a Java RMI Server.  Running this class
   keeps the Java RMI Server up an running till the 'Enter Key' is pressed on the console.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;- CalculatorClient.java : This class starts the SCA Runtime and deploys the CalculatorRMIReference.composite.  It then calls
   the deployed Calculator Components services which in turn uses the Java RMI Service for providing the calculator functions.
   
   <h4>Running the sample</h4>
   <p> - First run the CalculatorServer class.  This clss will start Calculator Java RMI Server which
   will be kept up and running until the 'Enter Key' is pressed on the console.
   <p> - Next run the CalculatorClient class.  This class will start the SCA Runtime, deploy the CalculatorRMIReference composite
   and invoke the Calculator Component's services displaying the the following to the standard output: 

<samp>
<br>3 + 2=5.0
<br>3 - 2=1.0
<br>3 * 2=6.0
<br>3 / 2=1.5
   
<p> Now go over to the console running the Calculator RMI Server and press the 'Enter' key to end that server.
