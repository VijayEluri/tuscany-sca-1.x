Calculator Sample
=================

This sample implements a simple calculator using SCA components. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

Sample Overview
---------------

This sample contains a single composite and a number of components as follows.

calculator\
  src\
    main\
      java\
        calculator\
          CalculatorService.java  - the first componet calls +-/* as appropriate
          AddService.java         - adds two numbers
          SubtractService.java    - substracts one number from another
          MultipleService.java    - multiplies two numbers
          DivideService.java      - divides one number by another
          CalculatorClient.java   - used when Ant is running the sample
      resources\
        Calculator.composite      - the SCA assembly for this sample
  calculator.png - a pictorial representation of the sample .composite file
  build.xml      - the Ant build file
  pom.xml        - the Maven build file        

The sample provides a single service with a default SCA (java) binding. The
CalculatorClient exercises this interface by calling add, subtract, multiply
and divide operations. This results in messages paaing to the appropriate 
components in the composite following the result is returned to the client and
displayed. 

Building And Runing The Sample Using Ant
----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant as 
follows

cd calculator
ant 

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] 3 + 2=5.0
     [java] 3 - 2=1.0
     [java] 3 * 2=6.0
     [java] 3 / 2=1.5

Building And Runing The Sample Using Maven 
------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd binding-echo
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.
