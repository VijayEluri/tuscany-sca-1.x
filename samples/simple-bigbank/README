Calculator Sample
=================
This sample implements a simple a version of the BigBank scenrio used in 
various places in the SCA specification documents. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

Sample Overview
---------------
The sample provides a composite with two java components wired together 
with a default binding. A request to the AccountComponent results in a 
requrest to the AccountDataComponent to get account data. The data retuns 
back via the AccountComponent to the client.

          bigbank.accountdata     - AccountDataComponent implementation
          bigbank.client          - starts the SCA Runtime and 
                                    deploys the BigBank.composite. 
                                    It then calls the deployed AccountService

  build.xml                       - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                         - the Maven build file        

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant as 
follows

cd simple-bigbank
ant 

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] Account summary: currency: USD, [ID:Foo_CHA12345, balance:1500.0, ID
:Foo_SAA12345, balance:1500.0, ID:Foo_STA12345, symbol:IBM, quantity:100]

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd simple-bigbank
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.
