Binding Echo Sample
===================
This sample demonstrates how new bindings are constructed for Apache Tuscany 
SCA. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

Sample Overview
---------------
This sample contains a implementation of an SCA binding that simply echoes back 
any messages that are sent to it. 

binding-echo/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        echo/                    - The binding interfaces
          impl/                  - The bindings model classes
          module/                - The activator that loads the binding into the 
                                   SCA runtime
          provider/              - The bindings runtime classes
          server/                - A dummy server that the binding is plugged into
      resources/
        EchoBinding.composite    - the SCA assembly for this sample
    test/
      java/ 
        echo/
          EchoBindingClient.java - used when Ant is running the sample
  binding-echo.png               - a pictorial representation of the sample 
                                   .composite file
  build.xml                      - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                        - the Maven build file
  
TBD - more detail required on how this sample adds a new binding to SCA

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant as 
follows

cd binding-echo
ant 

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] Returned message: foo
     [java] Echo reference = foo
     [java] Returned message: baa
     [java] Echo service = baa

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd binding-echo
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.

-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running echo.EchoReferenceTestCase
Returned message: foo
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.111 sec
Running echo.EchoServiceTestCase
Returned message: foo
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.121 sec

Results :

Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

This shows that the Junit test cases have run successfully.
