Implementation CRUD Sample
==========================
This sample demonstrates how new implementation types are constructed for 
Apache Tuscany SCA. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

Sample Overview
---------------
This sample contains a CRUD implementation type as an example of how to create
new implementation types. Components using this implementation type always
expose the same Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete interface. This sample
uses a singleton ResourceManager to perform the CRUD operations but of course
a real component would provide a real implementation. 

implementation-crud/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        crud/                  - implementation model interfaces
        crud.backend/          - fake component implementation
        crud.impl/             - implementations of the model interfaces
        crud.module/           - gets the implementation-crud module registered
                                 with the SCA runtime
        crud.provider/         - runtime implementation
      resources/
        crud.composite         - the SCA assembly for this sample
    test/

        crud/ 
          CRUDClient.java      - used when Ant is running the sample
  implementation-crud.png      - a pictorial representation of the sample 
                                 .composite file
  build.xml                    - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                      - the Maven build file
  
TBD - more detail required on how this sample adds a new implementation to SCA

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant as 
follows

cd implementation-crud
ant 

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] Starting CRUDServiceComponent
     [java] create(ABC) in tmp
     [java] retrieve(0)
     [java] Result from create: ABC
     [java] update(0)
     [java] retrieve(0)
     [java] Result from update: EFG
     [java] delete(0)
     [java] retrieve(0)
     [java] Result from delete: null
     [java] Stopping CRUDServiceComponent

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd implementation-crud
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.

retrieve(0)
update(0)
retrieve(0)

Stopping CRUDServiceComponent
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.212 sec

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

This shows that the Junit test cases have run successfully.
