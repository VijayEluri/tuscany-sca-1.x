Apache Tuscany SCA 0.90 (incubating) June 2007 Release Notes
============================================================

Overview
--------

This 0.90 release of Apache Tuscany SCA represents a significant
milestone on the road to 1.0.

This release includes a substantial redesign and rewrite of parts
of the Tuscany SCA runtime which has significantly improved usability
compared with previous releases. 

Key features include:

- now based on the final OSOA (http://www.osoa.org) 1.0 specifications;

- clear, simple and stable SPI's to aid embedding and extending the runtime;

- lightweight and modular, allowing users to pick and choose Tuscany modules
  as required for their particular environments.

The result of these improvements is that the Tuscany SCA runtime can now be
used easily in any environment - standalone, within webapps, embedded in any
application server, or even running inside an IDE.
 
No special tools, packaging, or plugins are required to create SCA
applications using Tuscany SCA. The standard Ant or Maven build tools,
or the simple JDK command line tools, are all that is required to
develop and use Tuscany SCA applications.

The modular nature of Tuscany now enables a complete runtime for SCA assembly 
to be put together with less than 1MB of Tuscany code.

See the CHANGES file for a detailed list of the features in this release.
