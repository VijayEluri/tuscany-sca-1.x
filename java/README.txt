Apache Tuscany M1 build (May, 2006)
===================================

http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany

Tuscany is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation
(ASF), sponsored by the Web Services PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.
