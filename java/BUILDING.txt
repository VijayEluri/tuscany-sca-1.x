Building tuscany/java
=====================

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install J2SE 5.0 SDK (1.5.0_06-b05 works)

2) Install Maven:
Download Maven 2.0.4 (download from http://maven.apache.org/download.html).



Building
--------

1) Change to the top level directory of the Tuscany Java project (tuscany/java) or at top level of your source distribution.
2) Execute: mvn

Note: Depending on the load of remote Mavan 2.0 repositories you may have to execute mvn several time until required
      dependencies are all located in your local maven repository.  After you have completed a full successful build you 
      can use "mvn -o" which is much faster.
